Event Training Protocol: Hybrid Threshold Training (HTT)

Overview

Whether you’re training for a marathon, a Hyrox event, a triathlon, or a local 10k, success comes down to one thing:

"Can you maintain performance under sustained stress?"

My approach is called Hybrid Threshold Training (HTT). It combines aerobic base building, lactate threshold conditioning, event-specific strength, and progressive simulation into a clear, structured plan.

This isn’t about guessing your way through mileage or randomly pushing intensity. We train smarter by understanding the energy systems, using data-based thresholds, and programming event simulations that build confidence and capacity.

Key Principles

1. Base before intensity

Aerobic base is the foundation for performance and recovery

2. Thresholds drive pace

Training at the right intensity zones builds sustainable speed

3. Simulation before competition

We train the body and brain for race-day conditions before the real thing

Training Breakdown

Weekly Overview (Example Hybrid Athlete)

Zone 2 Aerobic Conditioning: 2–3x/week (30–60 mins)

Threshold Intervals: 1x/week (tempo or lactate training)

Event-Specific Strength: 2x/week (e.g. sled push/pull, lunges, carries for Hyrox)

Mobility/Recovery: 1–2x/week (yoga, flow, myofascial release)

Simulation Workout: 1x every 2–3 weeks

Conditioning Zones

Zone 2 (60–70% max HR): Builds fat oxidation, capillary density

Threshold (80–90% max HR): Improves sustainable speed and power

VO2 Max (90%+ HR): Used sparingly in peak weeks

Progression Plan (12-week Block)

Weeks 1–4: Base Building

Prioritize Zone 2

Add easy strength + mobility

Weeks 5–8: Threshold Focus

Introduce intervals (e.g. 4x5min @ threshold pace)

Start event-specific work

Weeks 9–11: Simulation Peak

Simulate race-day effort and structure

Taper intensity, increase specificity

Week 12: Deload + Event Week

Low volume, light movement

Prioritize sleep, carbs, mental prep

Event-Specific Notes

Marathon / Long-Distance Running

Gradually build long runs (max ~80% of race distance)

Use run-walk strategy in early phases if needed

Practice fueling during runs (gels, water every 30 min)

Hyrox / Functional Fitness Events

Emphasize sled push/pulls, farmer carries, wall balls, rowing

Simulate transition fatigue: run 1km + exercise block

Focus on grip strength, midline endurance, and pacing transitions

Triathlon (Sprint / Olympic)

Balance swim-bike-run without overemphasizing one

Use brick workouts (bike > run) weekly

Dial in gear, hydration, and transitions

Recovery & Monitoring

1. HRV & Resting Heart Rate

Track with Oura, Whoop, or Garmin

Spike = back off or sleep more

2. Fueling for Recovery

Eat 30–60 mins post training (protein + carbs)

Don’t train fasted on hard days

3. Mobility Drills

Daily 5-min flow focused on hips, ankles, thoracic spine

Common Pitfalls I Coach Around

Doing too much too soon

Solution: Use 10% weekly progression cap

Training hard, recovering poorly

Solution: Sleep, fueling, HRV tracking are non-negotiables

No specificity

Solution: Train for the chaos of your event, not just generic cardio

Mindset Framework

"Endurance is built by embracing discomfort, not avoiding it."

Learn to pace yourself mentally as much as physically

Every run, every lift is mental training

Visualize the worst part of the race and train to dominate it

Summary: My Signature Process

Hybrid Threshold Training (HTT)

Zone 2 base gives you the engine

Threshold intervals raise your speed floor

Strength + simulation prepare you for chaos

You don’t just show up and hope. You train with strategy, recover with intention, and compete with confidence.
